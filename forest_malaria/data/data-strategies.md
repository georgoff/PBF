#### Alec Georgoff

### Objective
Determine how to use available data to fill out the Time-at-Risk matrix for the forest model.

### Data
_Forest Cover_: A raster of forest coverage is available [here](georgoff.github.io/forest_malaria/data/cambodia_hansen_any_forest_0pc_native.tif). This file contains a latitude/longitude pairs for the greater Cambodia region, which a binary indicator of forest coverage in each pixel.

_Village Locations_: A dataset of village locations is available [here](georgoff.github.io/forest_malaria/data/gis_osm_places_free_1.csv). This file has latitude/longitude of each location, as well as the type of location (village, town, etc.) and the population.
