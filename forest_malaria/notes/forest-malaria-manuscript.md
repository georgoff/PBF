## Forest Malaria Manuscript Outline

### Introduction
* Forest malaria is different than malaria in sub-saharan Africa
* Malaria "population" is defined as people exposed to the same mosquitoes
* Time-at-Risk affects exposure and transmission
  - Heterogeneous
* Ross-Macdonald equations
  - Need to be modified for forest malaria

### Methods
* Ross-Macdonald equations
* Equilibrium assumptions
* Multi-site approach
* Scaling by TaR

### Results
* One village, one forest
* Visualizations
  * 3D surface (vs p)
  * Heatmap

### Discussion
* Fragility
* Complex typologies and topologies
  * Hint at next paper
