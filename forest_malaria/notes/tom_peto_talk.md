### Elimination vs. Eradication
Gates foundation uses _eradication_ in their goals, on purpose - getting rid of all malaria in the world

### Species
_Falciparum_ is most important for mortality
_Vivax_ is important in SE Asia
* forms a “sleeping stage” in the liver that can be hard to treat

~7% of worldwide malaria cases are in SE Asia

Vector control is less effective in Asia - many vectors are day-biting so ITNs and IRS don’t work as well

Artemisinin combination therapy is 1st line treatment

2000-2013: funding for malaria grew by about 2000%

Antimalarial drug resistance &rarr; increased transmission

Multidrug resistance in the GMS: a public health threat - urgent to eliminate while tools work

Strategies to eliminate:
* Case management
* Vector control
* Screen and treat
    * Targeted malaria elimination: case management, vector control, & MDA

### Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
_Malaria Wars_, Leslie Roberts

Asymptomatic reservoir in GMS contributes to transmission

Community engagement important - people don't want to take drugs if they don't feel sick

If someone takes drugs and gets sick, they'll attribute it to the drug

Lots of effort to get MDA to work

High coverage can be undermined by population movement

Improvement:
* Ivermectin to kill vectors
* Mass screening and treatment using highly sensitive RDTs
* Add RTS,S/AS01
