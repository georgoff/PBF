Forest mapping function is working and available for use
* May add more functionality as needed
* Look into creating a shiny for use by CHAI, others

Alternate forest clustering algorithms
* Travel-time proximity to villages

Translating travel time to time-at-risk
* General trend: increase in travel time leads to decrease in time spent (and vice versa)
* Also less people from the village go
* Assume some proportional relationship?

Points:
1) Forest systems are fragile
	* bcV/r > 1/(1-p)
2) Coverage for forest going populations is different
