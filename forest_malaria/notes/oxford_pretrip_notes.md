# Oxford Trip - Alec Georgoff
### July 9-27, 2018

##### What We're Hoping to Obtain
* A list of villages in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)
* A list of forests in the GMS
  - Plus any topological information
* Village demographics
  - Proportion of villagers that travel to the forest
  - How much time is spent in the forests
    - TaR matrix (&Psi;)

##### Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) Goals
* Become familiar with MAP data
  - What data is available
  - How to access data
  - Restrictions on data
- MAP has geospatial data, but we want to aggregate up to country level
  - Lose spatial info
  - Convert PR to exposure &rarr; EIR, PfPR
- Be familiar with forecasting plans for malaria at IHME
  - Related to CoNIC work
  - Talking with Maddy - PBF on forecasting

##### Coverage-Related Goals
* Coverage &rarr; effect size
* Forest malaria has multiple "coverages"
  - Village coverage
  - Forest coverage
* Define coverage in the forest malaria system
