# Oxford Trip - Alec Georgoff
### July 9-27, 2018

##### What We're Hoping to Obtain
* A list of villages in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)
  - Richard Maude (is he cooperating with defining villages?)
  - Harry Gibson & Katie Battle
  - How good of a proxy for forests is forest cover
* A list of forests in the GMS
  - Plus any topological information
  - Definition of village
* Create travel model
* Surveillance data suggests high prevalence in forest-goers and not in villagers
  - Obtain this data
* Village demographics
  - Proportion of villagers that travel to the forest
  - How much time is spent in the forests
    - TaR matrix (&Psi;)

##### Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) Goals
* Become familiar with MAP data
  - What data is available
  - How to access data
  - Restrictions on data
- MAP has geospatial data, but we want to aggregate up to country level
  - Lose spatial info
  - Convert PR to exposure &rarr; EIR, PfPR
    - PR is aggregate of incidence and duration of infection
    - Model just gives incidence
    - Drug treatment or case management (treatment)
    - Check document
- Be familiar with forecasting plans for malaria at IHME
  - Related to CoNIC work
  - Talking with Maddy - PBF on forecasting
  - Michelle at MAP

##### Coverage-Related Goals
* Coverage &rarr; effect size
* Forest malaria has multiple "coverages"
  - Village coverage
  - Forest coverage
* Define coverage in the forest malaria system
* Case management - what fraction of incident malaria cases get treated
  - Implied population behind this
  - Forest and village populations make this definition complex
  - Want to measure case management in the "right way"
  - Talk to MAP people about how they come up with case management numbers (Ursula)
  - Clinical coverage (who does this at MAP?) - connect with Ewan about this
